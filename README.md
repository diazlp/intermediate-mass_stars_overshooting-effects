# intermediate-mass_stars_overshooting-effects
These scripts core purpose is for my final assignments to get my bachelor degree in Astronomy. 
The code itself plot the output from MESA-Web calculations for the "Effects of Overshooting in Intermediate-mass Stars". 

It heavily relies on mesa_reader modules created by Bill Wolf (hats off to you, sir). I purposefully included it on this repository, so readers can easily install them.


Mind you, most of the code is in my native language; which is in Bahasa.
