## Intermediate Mass Stars - Overshooting Effects
this repo is barely even a project. I made these for my final assignments to obtain my bachelor degree, Majoring in Astronomy. It is heavily relies on mesa_reader module created by Bill Wolf that is processing the output data from MESA-Web calculation regarding to star evolutions. In this particular repo, I modeled the star evolutions for intermediate mass stars.

If readers intent to run the scripts on their system. I suggest to clone/download this repo beforehand and preps some module that is required by the scripts. Additionally, I provided the module mesa_reader in this repo for your convenience.
